            <h2>Irresponsible Driving</h2>
            
            <h3>Use the horn!</h3>
            
            <p>Make sure to use your horn as often as possible! This allows other people to hear you when visibility is low. If you use it continuously, other drivers can use the Doppler effect to tell whether you're moving towards them or away from them.</p>

            <h3>Go easy on the brakes.</h3>
            <p>When sliding, turn in the direction you are sliding; counter steering will kick out the back of the car and you will start to spin.</p>

            <h3>Abandon ship if you have to!</h3>
            <p>It's fine to abandon your car as long as it is not in the middle of the road. (No one is stopping you from abandoning your car in the middle of the road, but you're more likely to be hit by another car there.)</p>

            <h2>Shopping to Win</h2>

            <h3>Choose high-value trading supplies.</h3>
            <img src="rainier.jpg">
            <p>In the post-apocalyptic wasteland that is to come, you will need valuable trade goods. When visiting the grocery store, choose long-lasting items that you can trade with other Snowzilla survivors. Canned vegetables can be eaten even if your power goes out, and six-packs of Rainier will maintain their value in the Arctic wasteland for years to come.</p>

            <h3>Take care of your health.</h3>
            <p>Make sure you're well-stocked on any prescription medication. It's also a good idea to maintain a first aid kit and keep a supply of common over the counter medicines.</p>

            <h3>Be prepared to fight!</h3>
            <p>The grocery store will run out of items quickly. Do not be afraid to ram other shoppers with your cart and use whatever means possible to secure supplies.</p>

            <h3>Get creative with your storage.</h3>
            <p>Frozen food can be stored outside when the tempature drops, so feel free to stock up. Make sure to defend your stores from raccoons; they have thumbs and can open packaging.</p>

            <h2>Ineffective Communications Strategies</h2>
            <h3>Be visible!</h3>
            <p> Mount the most powerful battery-powered strobe light you can find onto your helmet if you're planning to walk or cycle. This will help other people see you, and will definitely not confuse anyone or cause a traffic accident.</p>

            <h3>Take your mail into your own hands.</h3>
            <img src="iceball.jpg">
            <p>Mail service may be interrupted. If you have a good throwing arm, try freezing your message inside of a ball of ice and throwing it to your neighbors!</p>

            <h3>Morse Code is the international language.</h3>
            <p>Learn Morse code so that you can signal for help with lights.  Remember: SOS is three short, three long, three short.</p>

            <h2>Miscellaneous advice:</h2>

            <h3>Get the kids out of the house.</h3>
            <p>Remember to let the kids visit their friends beforehand so that when the snows hits they are stuck at someone else's house.</p>

            <h3>Become a cat whisperer!</h3>
            <p>Cats make great conversational partners; don't be afraid to have long, drawn-out conversations with them.</p>

            <h3>Universal snow advice no matter where you are in the galaxy.</h3>
            <p>Remember: DON'T PANIC, and bring your towel.</p>
